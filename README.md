# TicTacToe

  ->It's a dinamic Tic Tac Toe game which can be played with a friend or the computer.
  
  ->The default setting will bring up a 4*4 chart with 3 locked cells and 3 blocks to win. Although you can set your favorable settings if you wish.
  
  (In larger scales you may face some bugs and so I'm yet working on it.)
